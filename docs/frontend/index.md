# Crowd Captions - Frontend Documentation

If you'd like to develop on Frontend, follow the instructions below. By default, you'll also need to set up Backend to run at the same time, as the development version of the chrome extention will look for the API at http://localhost:8000/

# Get Started

First, install dependencies

- Install [NodeJS 14.17.6 LTS (or similar)](https://nodejs.org/)
- run `npm install`

Next, start up the server:

- `npm run serve`

Finally, install the chrome extention:

- Go to chrome://extensions/ and click "Load unpacked extension", then select the `dist` folder within this project to install it.
- Visit a [Panopto Recording](https://aucklandtest.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=17f5f2e4-3252-44e5-a32e-adcc002772d7) to test it out
